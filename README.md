<h1>Music Trivia Quiz</h1>
<p>The purpose of this project is to integrate Mongoose, Express, Underscore, jQuery, Bootstrap, javascript, schemas and templating to create an application.</p>
<p>My goals was to create a simple interactive quiz that would be fun for participants.</p>
<h2>Project Features</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>New users can create a login to play the quiz.</li>
    <li>Returning users can authenticate their login credentials to play the quiz.</li>
    <li>Videos stream from youtube and auto start/stop.</li>
    <li>Relevant quiz questions load next to the video.</li>
    <li>Quiz evaluates user score after submission of last quiz question.</li>
  </ol>
<h2>Outstanding Issues</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Users need to be able to log out. Establish whether sessions need to be incorporated to accomplish this.</li>
  <li>Update the quiz database: need to resolve http:// video sources to https://. The nested Mongoose schema for the quiz is challenging for me to update.</li>
  
</ol>
