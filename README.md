<h1>Music Trivia Quiz</h1>
<p>The purpose of this project is to integrate Mongoose, Express, Node, jQuery, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to create an application.</p>
<p>My goals was to create a simple interactive quiz that would be fun for participants.</p>
<h2>Project Features</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>New users can create a login to play the quiz.</li>
    <li>Returning users can authenticate their login credentials to play the quiz.</li>
    <li>Videos stream from youtube and auto start/stop.</li>
    <li>Relevant quiz questions load next to the video.</li>
    <li>Quiz evaluates user score after submission of last quiz question.</li>
  </ol>
<h2>Outstanding Issues</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Users need to be able to log out.</li>
  <li>Provide user error messages if passwords do not match, or login account doesn't exist. </li>

</ol>
<h2>Future Iterations of the Project</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Develop multiple quizzes. Users would be able to select skill level: easy, medium, difficult</li>
  <li>A more meaningful quiz evalution for users should be implemented. Perhaps returning "Correct" or "Incorrect" with the correct answer, then a final score at the end.</li>
</ol>
